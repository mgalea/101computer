    <hr>
    <p>We are from Malta, a small country that is home to some of the most historic computers and gaming
        consoles that shaped the information age and our modern culture.</p>

    <p>In 2023, individuals from various technology sectors have collaborated with the aim of
        consolidating interests in computing history in our country. </p>
    <p>To ensure comprehensive representation of all interests, a decision was made to establish a
        non-profit organization serving as an umbrella entity dedicated to Microcomputing related activities. </p>
    <p>The Microcomputing Society is tasked with representing interests in both vintage and modern
        computing, video gaming, mobile technology, microprocessors, microcontrollers, and IoTs</p>
